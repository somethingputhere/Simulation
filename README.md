# Simulation
## This repository involves two primary directories:
### 1. Representation_Learning: includes all code related to Algorithm 1.
### 2. Transfer_Learning: includes all code related to Algorithm 2.
## Instructions for Use:
### Upon entering the specified directory, execute Algorithm.ipynb to run the code on either Synthetic or Real-world data. This notebook will produce the relevant results. Furthermore, plot.ipynb helps the making of plots of the results.
